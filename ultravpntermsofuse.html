            <p class="privacy__date">Last Modified: July 22, 2016, Effective July 22, 2016</p>
            <p>The following UltraVPN Software License and Terms of Service Agreement (“Terms” or the “Agreement”) for the UltraVPN Software and Service is a legal contract between you, an individual subscriber (“You”), and AnchorFree, Inc. if you are a resident or citizen of the United States of America, or between You and AnchorFree GmbH (together with AnchorFree, Inc., “AnchorFree”), if you are not a resident or citizen of the United States of America, regarding your use of the UltraVPN Software to create a virtual private network (“VPN”) connection (the “Service”).</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY CLICKING THE “INSTALL” BUTTON TO INITIATE THE INSTALLATION OF THE UltraVPN SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING A BENEFIT BY USING THE SERVICE, AND THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT OF BINDING ARBITRATION FOR ALL LEGAL DISPUTES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE “I DECLINE” BUTTON AND THE UltraVPN SOFTWARE WILL NOT BE INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, YOU MUST DESTROY, RETURN OR DELETE ALL COPIES OF THE UltraVPN SOFTWARE IN YOUR POSSESSION.</p>
            <p>THE SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 OR TO ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED, TERMINATED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY ANCHORFREE.</p>
            <p>By clicking the “Install” button or by otherwise registering for, accessing or using the Service, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and have not been previously suspended or removed from the Service by AnchorFree.</p>
            <p><b>1. The Service.</b> AnchorFree provides the Service as a means of protecting your privacy by establishing a secure Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) connection when connecting to the Internet through unsecured networks or browsing unsecured websites. The Service’s VPN utilizes a proxy Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a “Proxy IP Address”).</p>
            <p><b>1.1 Free and Subscription Service.</b> You may choose whether to use the free Service or the subscription-based Service (the “Elite Service”). If You choose to use the free Service,  AnchorFree may deliver third-party advertisements (“Advertisements”). If You choose to use the Elite Service,  AnchorFree will not deliver any Advertisements.</p><p></p>

            <p><b>1.2 Traffic Protection.</b> The Service was developed to provide protection against hacking and other potential privacy vulnerabilities when surfing the Internet on an unsecure network, or browsing the Internet by creating a VPN that encrypts traffic to and from your Device, as defined in Section 6.1, and utilizing a Proxy IP Address provided by AnchorFree. However, software is not perfect and due to defects, bugs, or other reasons, or for no reason at all, AnchorFree does not guarantee that the Service will create a VPN or utilize a Proxy IP Address on all websites.</p>
            <p><b>2. UltraVPN Privacy Notice.</b> Your privacy is important to AnchorFree. AnchorFree's <a href="https://www.anchorfree.com/privacy/">UltraVPN Privacy Notice</a> is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read this notice carefully for information relating to the UltraVPN's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
            <p><b>3. Modification of these Terms.</b> AnchorFree reserves the right, at our discretion, to make non-material changes to these Terms at any time. Please check these Terms and any Guidelines periodically for changes. In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such change. We may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Service, by sending an email to any address you may have used to pay for UltraVPN Elite, or through other reasonable means. If you do not agree to the changed Terms you must discontinue your use of the Service. If you are a user of UltraVPN Elite and you elect to discontinue use of the Service due to a material change in these Terms, we will provide you with a refund as described in Section 9 below. All other changes are effective upon publication of the changed Terms.</p>

            <p><b>4. User Content</b></p>
            <p><b>4.1 User Content Generally.</b> Certain features of the Service, such as the UltraVPN Help Desk may permit users to post content, including messages, reviews, data, text, and other types of works (collectively, "User Content") and to publish User Content on the Service.

            <p><b>4.4 User Content Disclaimer.</b> We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that You or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. AnchorFree may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service You will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against AnchorFree with respect to User Content.

            <p><b>5.2 UltraVPN Software License Restrictions.</b> YOU MAY NOT (AND MAY NOT ALLOW A THIRD PARTY TO) RENT, LEASE, SUBLICENSE, SELL, ASSIGN, LOAN, USE FOR TIMESHARING OR SERVICE BUREAU PURPOSES OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THE UltraVPN SOFTWARE OR ANY OF YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

            <p><b>5.3 Content Restrictions.</b> YOU MAY NOT (AND MAY NOT ALLOW A THIRD PARTY TO) COPY, REPRODUCE, CAPTURE, STORE, RETRANSMIT, DISTRIBUTE, OR BURN TO CD (OR ANY OTHER FORMAT) ANY COPYRIGHTED CONTENT THAT YOU ACCESS OR RECEIVE WHILE USING THE UltraVPN SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICE. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK AND LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH PROHIBITED USE OF COPYRIGHTED CONTENT.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Service</b></p>
            <p><b>6.1 Availability.</b> AnchorFree agrees to allow You to use the UltraVPN Software solely to access the Service. A computer or other equipment enabled to access the Internet (a "Device") is required to utilize the Service. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your Device is sufficient and compatible for use with the Service. The speed and quality of the Service may vary and the Service is subject to unavailability, including emergencies, third party service failures, transmission, equipment or network problems or limitations, interference, signal strength, and maintenance and repair, and may be interrupted, refused, limited or curtailed. ANCHORFREE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURES TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY, ACCURACY OR QUALITY OF YOUR DATA, MESSAGES OR PAGES WHETHER OR NOT RELATED TO INTERRUPTIONS OR PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THE SERVICE. ANCHORFREE DOES NOT ENCRYPT ALL WEB TRAFFIC TO OR FROM YOUR DEVICE, AND ANCHORFREE DOES NOT PROVIDE A PROXY IP ADDRESS FOR ALL WEBSITES ON ALL MODES OF THE SERVICE.</p>
            <p><b>6.2 Denial of Access;</b> AnchorFree reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service at any time without any notice for its convenience.

            <p><b>6.4 Automatic Uploading, Routing and Caching.</b> The Services improve your use of the Internet, among other means by enabling your device to load portions of data from other UltraVPN users and by re-routing some of your requests through other UltraVPN users or UltraVPN resources (the "Value Exchange"). Your use of the Services will in turn enable other users to access portions of data from your device and to be re-routed through your device, thereby improving the Internet for other UltraVPN users. By using the Services you consent to the use of your device in the described manner and agree that other UltraVPN users may use your network connection and resources in return for your potential use of other users' resources for your own use. Note that UltraVPN will make its best effort not to enable any use of your device's resources unless your resources are idle at that time, and to maintain the highest levels of privacy and security. UltraVPN may also cache information you have accessed on your hard drive for future use. If you purchased a Premium account, portions of this section may not be applicable to you. You represent that your entry into this Agreement and your use of the Services does not breach any contract, duty, law, regulation or right, and that if sharing your resources is not desirable or allowed in your case, you will not use the Services, or purchase a Premium account to use the network but not to contribute resources to it.</p>
